# Pet project by Kim Stanislav tg:@ddday999


Technologies used: Docker, k3s, Grafana, Loki (Promtail), Prometheus, Gitlab, Gitlab-CI

Languages: Bash, Python


Includes:

1) A bot that re-sends the operatorâ€™s own message (bot.py)
2) Action Simulator - Bash script, which generating log in nginx format (log_creator.sh)
3) Kubernetes manifest to start bot.py and log_generator.sh in Deployment controller (easy_bot.yaml)
4) .gitlab-ci.yml pipeline
5) Configurations for Prometheus and Promtail


How it works:

Project starts with help of easy_bot.yaml manifest, its will run in Deployment k3s controller Telegram bot and Script, which simulating nginx log.
